MIRAGE - 1.0
=============

This framework is released as an opensource project using the MIT License.

Mirage is a powerful and modular framework dedicated to the security analysis of wireless communications. It actually provides :

 * a lightweight and hackable Bluetooth Low Energy protocol stack
 * multiple highly customizable offensive modules (e.g. Man-in-the-Middle, sniffing, jamming, hijacking, cloning …)
 * mutiple modules dedicated to information gathering (e.g. ATT/GATT dumping, scanning …)
 * a chaining operator allowing to easily combine attack modules in order to build complex attack workflows
 * supports of multiple Bluetooth Low Energy devices, such as HCI devices, BTLEJack and Ubertooth sniffers
 * supports of tools for monitoring HCI communications, using ADB or Hcidump
 * an user-friendly development environment allowing to easily write new modules or customize existing ones
